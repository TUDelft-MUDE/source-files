# Workshop 1.6: Pipe Dreams

In this workshop you will apply the propagation laws for the mean and variance for a function of two independent random variables. You will assess how well the approximations correspond with the <em>simulation-based</em> equivalents. You will also assess the distribution of the function.

### Objectives

1. Observe how uncertainty "propagates" from the inputs to the output of a function by estimating moments of the function of random variables and seeing how they change relative to the moments of the input random variables.
2. Recognize that a non-linear function of random variables that have the (joint) Normal distribution (the inputs) produces a non-Normal random variable (the output).
3. Using _sampling_ (Monte Carlo Simulation) to _validate_ the linearized error propagation technique introduced in the textbook. Specifically, by:
   1. Comparing the estimated moments with that of the sample, and
   2. Comparing the Normal distribution defined by the estimated moments to the sample
